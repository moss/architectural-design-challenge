What do I understand well, here?
- Rot13ing is easiest to do one character at a time.
- Output is easy to do with Java Writers, but they'll still need to be wrapped.

What don't I understand well?
- How to tie everything together.
- Reading the contents of a file is a little bit tricky.

What responsibilities do I see?
- Reading a file off of the filesystem.
- Translating plaintext to ROT13.
- Printing output to the console.
- Printing output to a file.
- Knowing which file to read from (and eventually which one to write to).

Architecture diagram:
AppRunner queries FileRepository for File
AppRunner prints File to Output
Output is an interface, implemented by:
- Something that writes to the console
- Something that writes to the filesystem
- A composite that writes to multiple outputs
- A facade that translates to ROT13 before
