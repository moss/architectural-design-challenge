* Consider extracting something for tying together the multiple outputs.
* Handle flushing correctly
  - No visible bugs showing up. Less obvious ones to worry about?
  - Output files.
  - Anything else?
* Fail on create files that already exist. With meaningful error message?
* Handle failure to create new file (is this different from above?).
* Review code quality
* Duplication in file path handling between Input and Output repositories.
