* Acceptance test
* Maybe need to think about the design a little bit
* Probably need a new kind of Output
* Create the file
* Write stuff to it
* Probably need a think to create that new kind of output
* Error if the file already exists?
* Something to act as a facade to the two outputs?
* Did I shoot myself in the foot by abandoning FakeOutput in the acceptance test, or will that make
  this easier? Or neither?
